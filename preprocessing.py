"""
This is script for preprocessing part of the VQF algorithm.
Notation used here refers to section IIA and IIB from the VQF article (see readme).
I specific equation is refered, it's equation from the paper.
Since the same variables are being used throughout the whole script, 
I've decided to write their description here to avoid redundancy.
** Arguments **
verbose 
Boolean flag.
If True, information about the execution will be printed to the console.
m_dict, p_dict, q_dict
Dictionaries representing numbers m, p and q.
Keys are indices of the bits.
Values are integers (0 or 1) or sympy expressions representing the variables (see eq. 1).
z_dict
Dictionary representing carry bits.
Keys are tuples of integers, where the first one is a starting bit and the second one is a target bit.
Values are the same as in case of p_dict and q_dict.
clauses
A list of clauses corresponding to the equations (2) and (3). 
They are represented as sympy expressions.
known_expressions
A dictionary of expressions which has been deducted from the clauses.
Keys are sympy expressions, either simple ones (e.g.: q_0), which represent single unknowns,
or more complex (e.g.: p_1*q_1). 
Values are either sympy expressions or integers (0 or 1).
